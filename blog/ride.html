      </header>
    
      <p class="post__text">There’s something about hitting a century on a bicycle that feels like a rite of passage. It’s not just about the distance—it’s about the challenge, the endurance, and the sheer joy of the ride. I recently completed a 100km ride, and I want to share the experience, the highs, the struggles, and what I learned along the way.

The Ride Begins

The morning of the ride, I was filled with anticipation. 100km is no small feat, and I knew pacing myself would be key. As I set off, the cool breeze and the rhythmic sound of my pedals spinning created a sense of calm. The first 20-30km felt smooth, my legs fresh and my mind focused.

The Middle Stretch: Where the Challenge Begins

Somewhere around the halfway mark, I started to feel the real effort kicking in. The excitement of the start had faded, and now it was about finding a steady rhythm. Hydration and nutrition became crucial—I made sure to sip water regularly and refuel with snacks to keep my energy levels up.

The toughest part came around 70-80km. My legs were screaming, and every slight incline felt like a mountain. But this is where the mental game comes in. I reminded myself why I was doing this—to push my limits, to experience the journey, and to prove to myself that I could.

<br><br>The Final Push<br><br>

As I neared the last 10km, a second wind hit. The thought of finishing pushed me forward, and I found myself picking up the pace. Fatigue was still there, but the excitement of completing the ride overpowered it.

Finally, I crossed the 100km mark. The feeling was a mix of exhaustion and exhilaration. I had done it!

<br><br>Lessons from the Ride<br><br>

1. Pacing is Everything – Going too fast at the start can burn you out. A steady, sustainable pace makes a huge difference.
<br>

2. Hydration & Nutrition Matter – Without enough fluids and energy, the last stretch can become unbearable.
<br>

3. The Mind is as Important as the Body – There were moments when my legs wanted to quit, but my determination kept me going.
