The covid 19 pandemic has affected educational systems         worldwide, leading to the near total closures of  schools, early childhood education         and care services, universities and colleges. It is the time to take necessary precau-         tions as covid 19s second wave is creating a grave situation in the country. This time         the severity and intensity of pandemic is causing immense distress and disruptions to         the whole society. Now is the time to be united and face the situation carefully.         Though the outbreak of COVID-19 has created many negative impacts on education,         educational institutions of India have accepted the challenges and trying their best         to provide seamless support services to the students during the pandemic. Indian         education system got the opportunity for transformation from traditional system         to a new era.  The pandemic has created a massive rise in teleconferencing, virtual         meetings, and webinars and e-conferencing opportunities.  The pandemic situation         induced people to learn and use digital technology and resulted in increasing the         digital literacy.  Educators and learners are getting opportunities to interact with peers         from around the world.         I wish you all good health and safety in your home or wherever you are staying. As         a  young  generation, you have also certain responsibilities towards the society.  I am         confident that you the Josephites can help the society in the best possible manner.         You have to remain strong yourselves to serve the society and the nation as a whole.                       The annual magazine is a symbolic compilation of the tireless efforts of         the students as well as their teachers. While on their journey to become future archi-         tects, this magazine provides a platform for the students to showcase their talents         and honour their achievements.         I extend my heartiest congratulations for all the efforts taken by the student writers,         the student editor\& the whole editorial board members on the launch of this maga-         zine and give my best wishes for their future pursuits.                                                                                                   11","12","13","14","15","skâv tPmk-^v þ            ]nXr-lr-Z-b¯nsâ hmÕ-eyhpw            kwc-£-Whpw ]Icp¶ ]nXmhv                                              Rev.Sr.Dr. Rose Bastin CHF            BtKmf It¯m-en-¡m-k` hn.-bu-tk-¸n-Xm-hnsâ hÀj-ambn {]           Jym-]n¨ hÀj-am-WtÃm 20-20- -21. \\oXn-am-\\mb a\\p-jy³ F¶m-           Wv hn.- {KÙw tPmk-^n\\v \\evIp¶ hnti-j-Ww.

How does one capture the “quidditas”, the essence of an amazing, multifaceted and un-         forgettable teacher named Dr Shali Anthappan. The teacher magician who waves her special         wand and enthralls her students making them spellbound forever; the teacher whose innate         qualities read like an encyclopedia of positives, superlatives, adjectives and nouns; the teach-         er who breathes poetry and visually brings to life dramas and novels; the grammar teacher         who turns the complexities of grammar and linguistics into something as delightful as eating         ice-cream; the teacher whose retention memory stores the names and details of the students         from 1989 onwards; the teacher who celebrates life and drinks life to the lees; the teacher who         shows by example how easy it is to juggle being a career woman and a homemaker.            The teacher who teaches her         students to spread their wings         and fly; the teacher who has         touched a thousand lives; the         teacher who is a true romantic of         the wordsworth’s ilk who loves         the flowers, the birds, the bees         and of course all the dogs in         the world; the teacher who is a         rock solid mentor, mother, sister,         friend and soulmate; the teacher         who has been the model teacher         of the department, evaluations         for decades. To sum up, Dr Shali         is the super coolest, heart sav-         viest ma’am at St Joseph’s in her         students’ words.                    Parting is a sweet sorrow for         her and all of us. But I can certain         Dr Shali feels a deep sense of fulfill-         ment of a role well played, of duties         well done, of bringing accolades         to her institution, of being the true         torch bearers of the traditions of the         department, of faithfully following         the footsteps of her illustrious for-         bears.               Teary eyed farewell are for ordi-         nary mortals. We literature   people         celebrate your 32 years teacher par         excellence.

Arts play an important role in human exist-         ence. Since cave man to this pandemic affected world, arts have special place in         every walks of life. It reassures a new start and set our mind at ease. The COVID-19         restrained and paralyzed social life; fenced our education and chained us in front         of the virtual screen. But survival being the sharpest arrow in human’s quiver, we         overcame this hardships. When the classrooms were shut we opened our new         doors to enhance the students and reduce the stress of online learning. Our college         conducted a virtual Arts fest 2020.  It was an online fiesta of 10 events. A huge num-         ber of participants participated in the program. The program was evaluated by an         efficient panel of judges and then prizes were announced. Later the programs were         made available to all the students through YouTube.         The students were excited to participate in events like “muziko”;  “Once up on         a time”; “camera on and click the shot” ;“dress to win”; unlock your past”;” just         dance”; “hurry up and shoot” “camera rolling and action”; “Fun with spices”; and         “troll trends”                                                The winners are as follows:-                                             Muzico                                            1st prize – Deva R Nair from 2nd dc Psychology                                            2nd prize  – Devika M     from Physics                                            3rd prize – Aiswaryamol K B  from 2nd dc Psychology                                              Once up on a Time                                            1st prize -
